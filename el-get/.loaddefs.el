Compile Emacs Lisp source files after the visiting buffers are saved.

After a buffer containing Emacs Lisp code is saved to its source
file update the respective byte code file.  If the latter does
not exist do nothing.  Therefore to disable automatic compilation
remove the byte code file.  See command `toggle-auto-compile' for
a convenient way to do so.

variant `auto-compile-on-save-mode'.  Also see the related

(autoload 'toggle-auto-compile "auto-compile/auto-compile" "\
Toggle automatic compilation of an Emacs Lisp source file or files.

Read a file or directory name from the minibuffer defaulting to
the visited Emacs Lisp source file or `default-directory' if no
such file is being visited in the current buffer.

If the user selects a file then automatic compilation of only
that file is toggled.  Since both `auto-compile-on-save' and
`auto-compile-on-save' only ever _recompile_ byte code files,
toggling automatic compilation is done simply by creating or
removing the respective byte code file.

If the user selects a directory then automatic compilation for
multiple files is toggled as follows:

* With a positive prefix argument always compile source files;
  with a negative prefix argument always remove byte code files.

* Otherwise the existence or absence of the byte code file of
  the source file that was current when this command was invoked
  determines whether byte code files should be created or removed.

* If no Emacs Lisp source file is being visited in the buffer
  that was current when the command was invoked ask the user what
  to do.

* When _removing_ byte code files then all byte code files are
  removed.  If `auto-compile-deletes-stray-dest' is non-nil this
  even includes byte code files for which no source file exists.

* When _creating_ byte code files only do so for source files
  that are actual libraries.  Source files that provide the
  correct feature are considered to be libraries; see
  `packed-library-p'.

* Note that non-libraries can still be automatically compiled,
  you just cannot _recursively_ turn on automatic compilation
  using this command.

* When `auto-compile-toggle-recompiles' is non-nil recompile all
  affected source files even when the respective source files are
  up-to-date.  Do so even for non-library source files.

* Only enter subdirectories for which `packed-ignore-directory-p'
  returns nil; most importantly don't enter hidden directories or
  those containing a file named \".nosearch\".

Show short help for the SQL modes.

Use an entry function to open an interactive SQL buffer.  This buffer is
usually named `*SQL*'.  The name of the major mode is SQLi.

Use the following commands to start a specific SQL interpreter:

    \\\\FREE

Other non-free SQL implementations are also supported:

    \\\\NONFREE

But we urge you to choose a free implementation instead of these.

You can also use \\[sql-product-interactive] to invoke the
interpreter for the current `sql-product'.

Once you have the SQLi buffer, you can enter SQL statements in the
buffer.  The output generated is appended to the buffer and a new prompt
is generated.  See the In/Out menu in the SQLi buffer for some functions
that help you navigate through the buffer, the input history, etc.

If you have a really complex SQL statement or if you are writing a
procedure, you can do this in a separate buffer.  Put the new buffer in
`sql-mode' by calling \\[sql-mode].  The name of this buffer can be
anything.  The name of the major mode is SQL.

In this SQL buffer (SQL mode), you can send the region or the entire
buffer to the interactive SQL buffer (SQLi mode).  The results are
appended to the SQLi buffer without disturbing your SQL buffer.

\(fn)" t nil)

(autoload 'sql-mode "sql/sql" "\
Major mode to edit SQL.

You can send SQL statements to the SQLi buffer using
\\[sql-send-region].  Such a buffer must exist before you can do this.
See `sql-help' on how to create SQLi buffers.

\\{sql-mode-map}
Customization: Entry to this mode runs the `sql-mode-hook'.

When you put a buffer in SQL mode, the buffer stores the last SQLi
buffer created as its destination in the variable `sql-buffer'.  This
will be the buffer \\[sql-send-region] sends the region to.  If this
SQLi buffer is killed, \\[sql-send-region] is no longer able to
determine where the strings should be sent to.  You can set the
value of `sql-buffer' using \\[sql-set-sqli-buffer].

For information on how to create multiple SQLi buffers, see
`sql-interactive-mode'.

Note that SQL doesn't have an escape character unless you specify
one.  If you specify backslash as escape character in SQL,
you must tell Emacs.  Here's how to do that in your `~/.emacs' file:

Open a network login connection via `ssh' with args INPUT-ARGS.
INPUT-ARGS should start with a host name; it may also contain
other arguments for `ssh'.

Input is sent line-at-a-time to the remote connection.

Communication with the remote host is recorded in a buffer `*ssh-HOST*'
\(or `*ssh-USER@HOST*' if the remote username differs).
If a prefix argument is given and the buffer `*ssh-HOST*' already exists,
a new buffer with a different connection will be made.

When called from a program, if the optional second argument BUFFER is
a string or buffer, it specifies the buffer to use.

The variable `ssh-program' contains the name of the actual program to
run.  It can be a relative or absolute path.

The variable `ssh-explicit-args' is a list of arguments to give to
the ssh when starting.  They are prepended to any arguments given in
INPUT-ARGS.

If the default value of `ssh-directory-tracking-mode' is t, then the
default directory in that buffer is set to a remote (FTP) file name to
access your home directory on the remote machine.  Occasionally this causes
an error, if you cannot access the home directory on that machine.  This
error is harmless as long as you don't try to use that default directory.

If `ssh-directory-tracking-mode' is neither t nor nil, then the default
directory is initially set up to your (local) home directory.
This is useful if the remote machine and your local machine
share the same files via NFS.  This is the default.

If you wish to change directory tracking styles during a session, use the
function `ssh-directory-tracking-mode' rather than simply setting the
